# Disease-Prediction
Data Preparation → Loaded, cleaned, and split the dataset.
Model Training → Trained SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest with cross-validation. Models have given 100% accuracy on test set
Testing & Evaluation → Made predictions, calculated accuracy, and combined model outputs using majority voting.
Inference System → Built a function to take symptoms as input and predict the disease.
Final Testing → Verified predictions using sample symptoms.
